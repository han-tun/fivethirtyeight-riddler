> Dakota Jones is back in action. In her quest to locate the Temple of Diametra, she has found another highly symmetric crystal. 
> However, nefarious agents have again gotten wind of her plans, and now Dakota and the crystal are nowhere to be found.

> And so, you must once again recreate the crystal using the data from Dakota’s laser scanner. 
> As a reminder, the scanner takes a 3D object and records 2D cross-sectional slices along the third dimension. 
> Here’s the looping animation file the scanner produced for the crystal this time:

> What sort of three-dimensional shape is the crystal? 
> No pressure — Dakota Jones, nay, the entire world, is counting on you to locate the lost temple!

## Plan

My plan is to read in the slices of the GIF, extract the information as a binary mask, identify the corners of the maks, and plot these corners in 3D-space.

## Setup

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment = "#>")

library(plotly)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(tidyverse)

theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

## Preparing the image data

I read in the GIF image data using the `read.gif()` function from the ['caTools'](https://cran.r-project.org/package=caTools) package.

```{r}
gif_path <- file.path("assets", "crystal_538.gif")
gif <- caTools::read.gif(gif_path)
```

The image is contained as a 3D matrix in the `image` slot.
The image matrix is numeric where each number corresponds to a color in the slice.

```{r}
names(gif)
```

```{r}
dim(gif$image)
```

```{r}
gif$image[1:5, 1:5, 1:3]
```

The built-in `image()` function can plot a matrix of numeric values.

```{r}
image(gif$image[, , 21])
```

I expected to only find two colors, the foreground and background, but the edge of the foreground and background sometimes had a slightly different color.

```{r}
table(gif$image[, , 20])
table(gif$image[, , 21])
table(gif$image[, , 22])
```

Luckly, the foreground always had the color `0`.
Therefore, I made a copy of the `gif$image` where all the 0 values were `TRUE` and the rest were `FALSE`.

```{r}
img <- gif$image
img <- img == 0
```

Finally, the first and last frames are empty, so I removed them.

```{r}
img <- img[, , -c(1, 101)]
```

## 'Tidy' the image data

I wanted to put the image data into a tidy format so that each row was a data point with columns `x`, `y`, and `z` (the slice of the GIF) for the data point's coordinates and a column `value` for the value (either `TRUE` or `FALSE`) of the point.
This was done by the `get_tidy_xy()` funciton that takes an index for which to slice `img`.

Then, I needed to get just the corners of the mask.
Thankfully, this was easy because all of the individual shages were rectangles.
Therefore, I could just filter for the points at the minimum and maximum `x` values and then the minimum and maximum `y` values.
This was done by `get_mask_corners()` that takes a tidy data frame like that produced by `get_tidy_xy()`.

Both of these functions were used in tandem to produce the `tidy_img` tibble.

```{r}
get_tidy_xy <- function(i) {
    m <- img[, , i]
    colnames(m) <- as.character(seq(1, ncol(m)))
    as.data.frame(m) %>%
        as_tibble() %>%
        mutate(y = 1:n()) %>%
        pivot_longer(-y, names_to = "x", values_to = "value") %>%
        mutate(x = as.numeric(x))
}


get_mask_corners <- function(df) {
    df %>%
        filter(value) %>%
        filter(x == min(x) | x == max(x)) %>%
        filter(y == min(y) | y == max(y))
}


tidy_img <- tibble(z = seq(1, dim(img)[3])) %>%
    mutate(xy = map(z, get_tidy_xy),
           xy = map(xy, get_mask_corners)) %>%
    unnest(xy)

tidy_img
```

I used the 'ggforce' library to plot the first few layers, individually, before going to 3D.

```{r}
tidy_img %>%
    filter(z %in% 1:9) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, group = z)) +
    facet_wrap(~ z) +
    ggforce::geom_shape() +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(100, 300, 500)) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(100, 300, 500)) +
    theme(
        panel.grid = element_line()
    ) +
    labs(x = "x", y = "y",
         title = "Surfaces through the image",
         subtitle = "Each plot is a slice of the gif")
```

Instead of nice rectangles, this produced a bow-tie shape.
This was because of the order of the points - they weree not in the correct order to draw a rectangle, but instead the top-left point was followed by the bottom-right point, causing the diagonal.
Therefore, the `arrange_tidy_xy()` function just rearranges each coordinate to properly draw a rectangle.

```{r}
arrange_tidy_xy <- function(df) {
    df <- df[c(1, 2, 4, 3), ]
}

tidy_img <- tidy_img %>%
    group_by(z) %>%
    nest() %>%
    mutate(data = map(data, arrange_tidy_xy)) %>%
    unnest(data)

tidy_img
```

```{r}
tidy_img %>%
    filter(z %in% round(seq(1, 99, length.out = 25))) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, group = z)) +
    facet_wrap(~ z) +
    ggforce::geom_shape() +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(100, 300, 500)) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(100, 300, 500)) +
    theme(
        panel.grid = element_line()
    ) +
    labs(x = "x", y = "y",
         title = "Surfaces through the image",
         subtitle = "Each plot is a slice of the gif")
```

## 3D Plotting

Finally, I could plot the points in 3D to create the shape of "Dakota Jones' crystal" as the Riddle requests.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_ly(data = tidy_img, x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, size = 1, 
        mode = "markers", opacity = 1.0, type = "scatter3d")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
plt <- plot_ly(data = tidy_img, x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, size = 1, 
        mode = "markers", opacity = 1.0, type = "scatter3d")

plot_dir <- "2020-05-01_riddler-flip-to-freedom_plots"
saveWidget(plt, 
           file.path(plot_dir, "plot1.html"),
           selfcontained = FALSE, 
           libdir = file.path(plot_dir, "libdir"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::tags$iframe(
    src = file.path(plot_dir, "plot1.html"),
    width = "800px",
    height = "500px",
    scrolling = "no", 
    seamless = "seamless",
    frameBorder = "0"
)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_ly(data = tidy_img, x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, size = 1, 
        mode = "line", opacity = 0.5, type = "scatter3d")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
plt <- plot_ly(data = tidy_img, x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, size = 1, 
        mode = "line", opacity = 0.5, type = "scatter3d")
saveWidget(plt, 
           file.path(plot_dir, "plot2.html"),
           selfcontained = FALSE, 
           libdir = file.path(plot_dir, "libdir"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::tags$iframe(
    src = file.path(plot_dir, "plot2.html"),
    width = "800px",
    height = "500px",
    scrolling = "no", 
    seamless = "seamless",
    frameBorder = "0"
)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_ly(data = tidy_img, x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, type = "mesh3d")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
plt <- plot_ly(data = tidy_img, x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, type = "mesh3d")
saveWidget(plt, 
           file.path(plot_dir, "plot3.html"),
           selfcontained = FALSE, 
           libdir = file.path(plot_dir, "libdir"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::tags$iframe(
    src = file.path(plot_dir, "plot3.html"),
    width = "800px",
    height = "500px",
    scrolling = "no", 
    seamless = "seamless",
    frameBorder = "0"
)
```
